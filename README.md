In this repo I will be learning about AJAX an Fetch API

  I just added my files and broilerplate to do some exercises with AJAX calls.

  I made a button, and on click, it will run a function that will create a new XMLHttpRequest. Then with .open I pass in 3 peramiters, 1st is the type of request I am making - in this case GET, 2nd is the file name I am fetching from, then third is a boolean for asynchronous or not.
  After that I use .onLoad to do what I want with the data that I recieve, in this case I output it into the DOM and have it go away after 2 seconds just for fun.
